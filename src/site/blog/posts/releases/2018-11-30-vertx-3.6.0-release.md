We are pleased to announce the Eclipse Vert.x 3.6.0 release.

As always, the community contributions have been key in achieving this milestone. 
To all of you who participated: thank you, you are awesome!

Without further ado, let's take a look at some of the most exciting new features and enhancements.  

#### Vert.x Cassandra client

In this release we introduce the [Vert.x Cassandra client](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-cassandra-client), an extension for interation with [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/).

The client supports:
* prepared queries
* batching
* query streaming
* bulk fetching
* low level fetching

To give you an idea of how the API usage may looks like, we provide this example:

```java
cassandraClient.queryStream("SELECT my_string_col FROM my_keyspace.my_table where my_key = 'my_value'", queryStream -> {
    if (queryStream.succeeded()) {
    CassandraRowStream stream = queryStream.result();

    // resume stream when queue is ready to accept buffers again
    response.drainHandler(v -> stream.resume());

    stream.handler(row -> {
        String value = row.getString("my_string_col");
        response.write(value);

        // pause row stream when we buffer queue is full
        if (response.writeQueueFull()) {
        stream.pause();
        }
    });

    // end request when we reached end of the stream
    stream.endHandler(end -> response.end());

    } else {
    queryStream.cause().printStackTrace();
    // response with internal server error if we are not able to execute given query
    response
        .setStatusCode(500)
        .end("Unable to execute the query");
    }
});
```

#### Vert.x Web API Service

After [Vert.x Web API Contract](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web-api-contract/java/), we introduce a new package to simplify Web API development with [OpenAPI 3](https://www.openapis.org/): [Vert.x Web API Service](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web-api-service/java/)

Now when you build a router with `OpenAPI3RouterFactory` you can redirect requests directly to event bus services generated with the new annotation `@WebApiServiceGen`.
The router factory mounts for you the handler that pack the request parameters and redirects it to the event bus. When the service replies, the handler writes response to the client:

![Web API Service Architecture](/assets/blog/vertx-web-api-service/vertx-web-api-service.png)
 
You can write a service interface like this:

```java
@WebApiServiceGen
interface TransactionService {
  void getTransactionsList(String from, String to, OperationRequest context, Handler<AsyncResult<OperationResponse>> resultHandler);
  void putTransaction(JsonObject body, OperationRequest context, Handler<AsyncResult<OperationResponse>> resultHandler);
}
```

And mount it to router factory using OpenAPI extensions or service interface!

The interesting part is that [event bus](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#event_bus) provides itself important features like load balancing, distribution of requests across different Vert.x instances and bridging.

Check the [complete documentation](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web-api-service/java/) for more details. A tutorial post is coming soon!

#### Web Client

Our beloved [WebClient](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web-client/java/) is now capable of handling client sessions. The
`WebClientSession` is a client extension that is very helpful when you need to manage cookies on the client side.

```java
// The session is created per user
// from now on cookies are handled by the session
WebClientSession session = WebClientSession.create(client);
```

Cherry on the cake, the web client is now capable of performing server side response checks using _response predicates_:

```java
client
  .get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri")
  .expect(ResponsePredicate.SC_SUCCESS)
  .expect(ResponsePredicate.JSON)
  .send(result -> { ... });
```

The server side response must validate the expectations defined before sending the request in order to make the response
successful, relieving the user code to perform these checks manually. Of course many out of box expecations are provided
and you can always create your own to implement custom checks.

#### External configuration of Vert.x options

Whether you run your Vert.x app with the CLI or as an executable JAR with the `Launcher`, you can now provide Vert.x options as a command line parameter:

```
java -jar my-app.jar -options /path/to/my/file.json
```

Or with the CLI:

```
vertx run my-verticle.js -options /path/to/my/file.json
```

This is particularly useful for complex clustered eventbus setups (encryption, public host vs cluster host... etc).

#### And more...

We obviously can't list the many bug fixes that are included. But here are some more important new features you can find in this release:

- Hazelcast Cluster Manager support for lite members

#### Finally

The [3.6.0 release notes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/3.6.0-Release-Notes) can be found on the wiki.

Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/vertx/).

The Vert.x distribution can be downloaded on the website but is also available from [SDKMan](http://sdkman.io/index.html) and [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/).

The event bus client using the SockJS bridge is available from:

* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vertx3-eventbus-client)
* [Bower](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-bus-bower)
* [WebJars](http://www.webjars.org/)

The release artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22io.vertx%22%20AND%20v%3A%223.6.0%22) and you can get the distribution on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/vertx/downloads/distribution/3.6.0/view).

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/community).
