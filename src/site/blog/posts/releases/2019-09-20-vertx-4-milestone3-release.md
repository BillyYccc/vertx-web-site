We are extremely pleased to announce the third 4.0 milestone release of Eclipse Vert.x .

Vert.x 4 is the evolution of the Vert.x 3.x series that will bring key features to Vert.x.

This release aims to provide a reliable distribution of the current development of Vert.x 4 for people that
want to try it and provide feedback.

#### Futurisation

Vert.x 4 extends the 3.x callback asynchronous model to a future/callback hybrid model.

```java
public interface NetClient {

  // Since 3.0
  void connect(int port, String host, Handler<AsyncResult<NetSocket>> handler);

  // New in 4.0
  Future<NetSocket> connect(int port, String host);
}
```

This third milestone makes progress and coverts the following stack modules:

- vertx-service-discovery
- vertx-config
- vertx-circuit-breaker

#### Data object mapping for service proxies

Vert.x 3 service proxies is a lightweight layer on top of Vert.x Event-Bus providing typed contracts.

One can easily create a service on top of the Event-Bus.

```java
@VertxGen
interface DateService {

  // callback the handler with the current date
  void date(Handler<AsyncResult<String>> handler)
}
```

Service proxies request/response payload are of type JSON.

Of course service proxies allow to map beans to JSON using data objects but this comes with two caveats

- only JSON object can be mapped
- the data object must be a `@DataObject` annotated bean with a `toJson()` method and a JSON object constructor

In Vert.x 4 we extend the data object support to any Java class and any JSON type, e.g in this example

```java
@VertxGen
interface DateService {

  // encode the date with iso date format
  @Mapper static String toJson(ZonedDateTime value) {
    return ZonedDateTime.format(value);
  }

  // decode the date with iso date format
  @Mapper static ZonedDateTime fromJson(String value) {
    return ZonedDateTime.parse(value);
  }

  // callback the handler with the current date
  void date(Handler<AsyncResult<ZonedDateTime>> handler)
}
```

The generated code will then use these mappers to encode and decode JSON values.

For reusability mappers can also be `java.util.function.Function` instead, e.g

```java
@Mapper Function<String, ZonedDateTime) fromJson = ZonedDateTime::parse;
@Mapper Function<ZonedDateTime, String> toJson = ZonedDateTime::toString;
```

#### Vert.x Web utilities

While the routing context will allow you to access the underlying request and response objects, sometimes it will be
more productive if a few shortcuts would be present to help with common tasks. A few helpers are present in
the context to facilitate with this task.

Serve an "attachment", an attachment is a response that will trigger the browser to open the response on the OS application
configured to handle a specific mime type. Imagine youâ€™re generating a PDF:

```java
routingContext
  .attachment("weekly-report.pdf")
  .end(pdfBuffer);
```

Perform a redirect to a different page or host. One example is to redirect to an HTTPS variant of the application:

```java
routingContext.redirect("https://securesite.com/");
```

Send a JSON response to the client:

```java
// no need to specify the content type headers
rc.json(new JsonObject().put("hello", "vert.x"));
```

Simple content type check:

```java
if (routingContext.is("application/json")) {
  // ...
}
```

Verify if a request is "fresh" with respect to the cache headers and the current values of last modified/ etag:

```java
if (rc.isFresh()) {
  // client cache value is fresh perhaps we
  // can stop and return 304?
}
```

#### Other changes

- Groovy has been simplified in Vert.x 4 to remove code generation that was not really needed in practice
- The original Redis client deprecated in 3.7 has been removed replaced by the new Redis client
- JSON changes
  - Jackson databind is now an optional Maven dependency which means that applications need to explicitly add this dependency to the classpath
  - Specific Jackson utility methods are moved to specific Jackson classes
  - Vert.x can use an alternative implementation than Jackson for JSON encoding and JSON decoding
- The following components have reached their end of life and have been pruned
  - MySQL / PostgreSQL async client replaced by the Vert.x SQL Client (since 3.8)
  - AMQP bridge replaced by the Vert.x AMQP Client (since 3.7)

#### Ramping up to Vert.x 4

Instead of developing all new features exclusively in Vert.x 4, we introduce some of these features in the 3.x branch
so the community can benefit from them. The Vert.x 4 development focus on more fundamental changes that cannot be done
in the 3.x series.

This is the third milestone of Vert.x 4, we aim to release Vert.x 4 by the end of this year and you can of course
expect more milestones to outline the progress of the effort.

#### Finally

The [deprecations and breaking changes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/4.0.0-Deprecations-and-breaking-changes)
 can be found on the wiki.

For this release there are no Docker images.,

The release artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.vertx%20AND%20v:4.0.0-milestone2) and you can get the distribution on [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/vertx/vertx-stack-manager/4.0.0-milestone2/).

You can bootstrap a Vert.x 4.0.0-milestone2 project using https://start.vertx.io.

The documentation has been deployed on this preview web-site https://vertx-ci.github.io/vertx-4-preview/docs/

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/community).
