#### JUnit 5 support

This release introduces the new [vertx-junit5 module](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-junit5).

[JUnit 5](http://junit.org/junit5/) is a rewrite of the famous Java testing framework that brings new interesting features, including:

* nested tests,
* the ability to give a human-readable description of tests and test cases (and yes, even use emojis),
* a modular extension mechanism that is more powerful than the JUnit 4 runner mechanism (@RunWith annotation),
* conditional test execution,
* parameterized tests, including from sources such as CSV data,
* the support of Java 8 lambda expressions in the reworked built-in assertions API,
* support for running tests previously written for JUnit 4.

Suppose that we have a `SampleVerticle` verticle that exposes a HTTP server on port 11981.
Here is how we can test its deployment as well as the result of 10 concurrent HTTP requests:

```
@Test
@DisplayName("ðŸš€ Deploy a HTTP service verticle and make 10 requests")
void useSampleVerticle(Vertx vertx, VertxTestContext testContext) {
  WebClient webClient = WebClient.create(vertx);
  Checkpoint deploymentCheckpoint = testContext.checkpoint();
  
  Checkpoint requestCheckpoint = testContext.checkpoint(10);
  vertx.deployVerticle(new SampleVerticle(), testContext.succeeding(id -> {
    deploymentCheckpoint.flag();
  
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      webClient.get(11981, "localhost", "/")
        .as(BodyCodec.string())
        .send(testContext.succeeding(resp -> {
          testContext.verify(() -> {
            assertThat(resp.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
            assertThat(resp.body()).contains("Yo!");
            requestCheckpoint.flag();
          });
        }));
    }
  }));
}
```

The test method above benefits from the injection of a working `Vertx` context, a `VertxTestContext` for dealing with asynchronous operations, and the guarantee that the execution time is bound by a timeout which can optionally be configured using a `@Timeout` annotation.

The test succeeds when all checkpoints have been flagged.
Note that `vertx-junit5` is agnostic of the assertions library being used: you may opt for the built-in JUnit 5 assertions or use a 3rd-party library such as [AssertJ](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/) as we did in the example above.

You can checkout the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-junit5), read [the manual]({{ site_url }}docs/vertx-junit5/java/) and learn from [the examples](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/master/junit5-examples).
