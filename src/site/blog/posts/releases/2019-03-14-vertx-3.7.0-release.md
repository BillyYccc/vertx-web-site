We are extremely pleased to announce that the Eclipse Vert.x version 3.7.0 has been released.

It is an exciting milestone for a couple of reasons:

1. it comes with great new features like the [GraphQL extension for Vert.x Web](#vertx-web-graphql).
2. this is the last minor version before Vert.x 4! 

Before we go throught the most notable new features, we would like to thank all the contributors.
Your participation has been essential to this achievement.

#### <a id="vertx-web-graphql">Vert.x Web GraphQL</a>

Vert.x Web GraphQL extends Vert.x Web with the [GraphQL-Java](https://www.graphql-java.com) library so that you can build a GraphQL server.

To use this new module, add the following to the _dependencies_ section of your Maven POM file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-web-graphql</artifactId>
  <version>3.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Or, if you use Gradle:

```
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-web-graphql:3.7.0'
```

Then create a Vert.x Web `Route` and a `GraphQLHandler` for it:
     
```java
// Setup the GraphQL-Java object
GraphQL graphQL = setupGraphQLJava();
// Use it to handle requests on a Vert.x Web route 
router.route("/graphql").handler(GraphQLHandler.create(graphQL));
```

The GraphQL handler supports out of the box:

- query context customization
- GraphQL-Java data loaders
- batching on `POST` requests (compatible with the [`apollo-link-batch-http`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/batch-http.html) transport)

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [Vert.x Web GraphQL documentation](/docs/vertx-web-graphql/java/).

#### Vert.x Cassandra Client

##### Client lifecyle revisited

When the Vert.x Cassandra Client was introduced in 3.6, users were expected to `connect` manually before sending requests.
Besides, it was possible to `disconnect` a shared client thus failing requests sent from another verticle or part of the application.
As a consequence, the client lifecyle has been revisited in 3.7.

It is no longer required to connect a client (in fact, the method has been removed).
As soon as you retrieve an instance you can start working with it, the lifecyle will be managed automatically:

```java
CassandraClientOptions options = new CassandraClientOptions()
  .addContactPoint("node1.address")
  .addContactPoint("node2.address")
  .addContactPoint("node3.address")
  .setKeyspace("my_keyspace");
CassandraClient sharedClient = CassandraClient.createShared(vertx, "sharedClientName", options);
// Start sending requests to Cassandra with the client instance
```

Similarly, when the new `close` method is invoked on a shared client, only the last active instance will actually disconnect from Cassandra:

```java
// Disconnects only if this is the last running instance of the shared client
sharedClient.close();
```

##### Object mapper support

Vert.x Cassandra Client now supports the [cassandra-driver-mapping](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/tree/3.x/manual/object_mapper) module.

To enable this feature, you need to update your classpath by adding:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.datastax.cassandra</groupId>
  <artifactId>cassandra-driver-mapping</artifactId>
  <version>3.7.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Then for a given entity: 

```java
@Table(keyspace = "test", name = "users")
class User {
  @PartitionKey String name;
  // ... other fields and methods 
}
```

You can retrieve a mapper and execute CRUD operations:

```java
VertxMappingManager manager = VertxMappingManager.create(cassandraClient);
VertxMapper<User> mapper = manager.mapper(User.class, vertx);
mapper.save(new User("john", hander -> {}));
```

##### Collector API 

The feature allows to use Java [collectors](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collector.html) for query results:

```java
// Create a collector projecting a row set to a string in the form (last_name_1,last_name_2,...)
Collector<Row, ?, String> collector = Collectors.mapping(
    row -> row.getString("last_name"),
    Collectors.joining(",", "(", ")")
);

// Run the query with the collector
client.execute("SELECT * FROM users", collector, ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    // Result in the form (last_name_1,last_name_2,...)
    String result = ar.result();
  } else {
    System.out.println("Failure: " + ar.cause().getMessage());
  }
});
```

##### Cursor API

The `ResultSet` object has been enhanced with `ResultSet#several` method, allowing you to obtain several rows at once:

```java
resultSet.several(30, ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    List<Row> result = ar.result();
  } else {
    System.out.println("Failure: " + ar.cause().getMessage());
  }
});
```

This can be useful when you want to iterate through the results in batches without resorting to streaming or loading all rows in memory.

#### Vert.x Redis Client

TODO (Paulo)

#### Vert.x AMQP Client

Todo (ClÃ©ment)

#### Stream pipes

When it comes to streaming, back-pressure is something you need to care about.

You have very much likely heard or used the Vert.x `Pump` API to transfer data from a read stream to a write stream while respecting the write stream back-pressure.

The `Pipe` a new API superseding the `Pump` to achieve the same effect and even more, it acts like a pump and handles for you

- read stream pause/resume
- write stream termination
- stream failures handling
- asynchronous result upon streaming completion

You can transfer a read stream to a write stream simply, the write stream will be ended upon completion of the stream

```java
readStream.pipeTo(writeStream);
```

You can also be notified when the pipe completes:

```java
readStream.pipeTo(writeStream, ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    System.out.println("done");
  } else {
    System.out.println("failed " + ar.cause());
  }
});
```

Creating and using an asynchronous pipe is easy

```java
// The read stream will be paused until the pipe is used
Pipe<Buffer> pipe = readStream.pipe();
getAsyncPipe(ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    pipe.to(writeStream);
  } else {
    pipe.close();
  }
});
```

#### Kafka admin client

The new version brings a Vert.x based first implementation of the native [Kafka Admin Client API](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#adminapi) which are in Java, instead of Scala used in the previous version.

The `AdminUtils` is now deprecated and the new `KafkaAdminClient` is available instead.
It allows to remove the last Scala dependency.
One more interesting thing is that, while the `AdminUtils` implementation needs to connect to Zookeeper for administration purposes, the `KafkaAdminClient` just uses the Kafka bootstrap brokers connection.

```java
Properties config = new Properties();
config.put(AdminClientConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "my-kafka-broker:9092");

KafkaAdminClient adminClient = KafkaAdminClient.create(vertx, config);
```

The features currently supported are:

- create and delete topics
- list all the topics
- describe topics for getting information about leader partition, follower replicas and ISR (in-sync replicas) list
- alter topics configuration
- list all consumer groups
- describe consumer groups for getting information like the state, the coordinator host, consumers per topics and so on

Please, if you are using the `AdminUtils` today, consider to migrate to the new `KafkaAdminClient` because the former will be removed soon.

#### And more...

Here are some other important improvements you can find in this release:

- Shared data structures available in local-only mode even when Vert.x is clustered
- JSON decoding without prior knowledge of the structure (object, array, string, ...etc)
- Infinispan Cluster Manager upgraded to [Infinispan](https://infinispan.org) 9.4.10.Final
- And obviously we have the usual bug fixes!
