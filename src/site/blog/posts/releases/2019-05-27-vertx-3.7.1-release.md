We have just released Vert.x 3.7.1, a bug fix release of Vert.x 3.7.x and a few small features.

Since the release of Vert.x 3.7.0, quite a few bugs have been reported. We would like to thank you all for reporting these issues.

In addition of bug fixes, this release prepares the ground for Vert.x 4 with a few enhancements and deprecations.

### HTTP client Unix Domain Sockets

Since this release the `HttpClient` supports [Unix Domain Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) when using
Netty's native transports, which can be really useful if you need to connect to a local daemon such as Docker's Daemon:

```
HttpClient httpClient = vertx.createHttpClient();

// Only available on BSD and Linux with native transport
SocketAddress addr = SocketAddress.domainSocketAddress("/var/tmp/myservice.sock");

// Send request to the server
httpClient.request(HttpMethod.GET, addr, 8080, "localhost", "/", resp -> {
  // Process response
}).end();
```

### HTTP client WebSocket connect revisited

The `HttpClient` WebSocket methods have been revisited, indeed these methods were lacking of usability in general or
with vertx-rx due to the optional error handling:

```java
HttpClient client = vertx.createHttpClient();
client.websocket(80, "example.com", "/", websocket -> {
  // connected
});

// or

client.websocket(80, "example.com", "/", websocket -> {
  // connected
}, err -> {
  // handle error
});

```

The new `webSocket` method provides now the best developer experience for connecting a WebSocket:

```java
HttpClient client = vertx.createHttpClient();
client.webSocket(80, "example.com", "/", ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    // connected
  } else {
    // handler error
  }
});
```

With RxJava2, you can use now:

```java
HttpClient client = vertx.createHttpClient();
Single<WebSocket> single = client.rxWebSocket(80, "example.com", "/");
single.subscribe(
  ws -> {
    // connected
  },
  err -> {
    // handle error
  });
```

### Vert.x Rx usability improvements

As you may know, the [Vert.x _Rxified_ API](/docs/vertx-rx/java2/#_rxified_api) is generated from the bare Vert.x API.

In this release, `vertx-codegen` has been improved to determine if an API object is an `Iterable`, `Iterator`, or `Function`.
Then its _Rxified_ equivalent will be an `Iterable`, `Iterator`, or `Function` too.

Let's take an example.
The Vert.x `MultiMap` class represents a multi-map of `String` keys to a list of `String` values.
It's useful to represent things like HTTP headers and parameters which allow multiple values for keys.

Since the bare `io.vertx.core.MultiMap` implements `Iterable<Map.Entry<String, String>>`, you can iterate through the content with a `for-each` loop.
Starting with 3.7.1, the same is possible with the _Rxified_ version:

```java
io.vertx.reactivex.core.MultiMap headers = request.headers();
for (Entry<String, String> header : headers) {
  // inspect header  
}
```

Or, for advanced transformations:

```java
Flowable<Entry<String, String>> headers = Flowable.fromIterable(request.headers());
```

### GraphiQL IDE

Vert.x 3.7.0 added support for building [GraphQL servers](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web-graphql/java/) with Vert.x Web and [GraphQL-Java](http://graphql-java.com/).

In 3.7.1, the GraphQL handler can be configured to expose the GraphiQL IDE:

```java
GraphQLHandlerOptions options = new GraphQLHandlerOptions()
  .setGraphiQLOptions(new GraphiQLOptions()
    .setEnabled(true)
  );

router.route("/graphql").handler(GraphQLHandler.create(graphQL, options));
```

### Vert.x 3.8.0 is the next release

The next version of Vert.x will be 3.8 and targets end of June / early July with the following themes:

- Introducing a Promise interface to be used instead of Future in a couple of places of the codebase such as `Verticle` start or
`executeBlocking`. The goal is to move the completion part in Vert.x 4 from `Future` to `Promise` which becomes the object to be
completed and `Future` is a view that is consumed by clients
- Json Pointer support
- The new SQL client will be released as tech preview (until v4)
- RedisPool as tech preview (until v4) bring back connection management, lazy reconnect and scaling to all client modes (Single, Sentinel and Cluster)

* https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-bus-bower
* http://www.webjars.org/

Docker images are also available on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/vertx/). The Vert.x distribution is also available from [SDKMan](http://sdkman.io/index.html) and [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/).

The artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22io.vertx%22%20AND%20v%3A%223.6.3%22) and you can get the distribution on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/vertx/downloads/distribution/3.7.1/view).

Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/community).
